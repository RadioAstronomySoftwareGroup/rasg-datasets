# rasg-datasets
Data used for testing RASG repos.

Data files are organized first by data type (visibility data, calibration solutions,
primay beam models, flagset files) and then by telescope. Readme files in each
folder gives basic information about the data provenance. 
The data sets are generally strongly downselected to keep the data volume small,
so are much smaller than typical datasets from their respective telescopes.
