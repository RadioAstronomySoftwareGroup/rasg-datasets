Notes: Visibility files were written to MWA correlator FITS files by the MWA
correlator (legacy). Converted to a uvfits by Cotter. Calibration solutions were
calculated and written out with FHD. Note there are files from multiple separate
runs of FHD on the same data with different settings for code coverage purposes.
