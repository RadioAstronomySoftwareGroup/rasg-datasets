# HERA beams

## NicCSTbeams

Sample files at particular frequencies from CST simulations of the HERA beam
(both with the PAPER dipole feeds and the phase 2 Vivaldi feeds). Simulations
were done by Nicolas Fagnoni (see papers for details).


## HERABEAM.FITS

An CASA HERA beam model in an orthoslant projection for the RA/DEC at zenith
at a particular time. Provenance unknown, suspected to be a simple Airy disk with
the correct diameter. Used for testing uvbeam support for ra/dec gridded beams.
